BP-HMM + SPCM Paper

Code 
https://github.com/nbfigueroa/tGau-BP-HMM

go to ./Experiment/SecondHands
PreProcess_Mocap.m and Segment_Mocap.m

In order to run the mocap functions you must have the following toolboxes in your path:

1st Goal: Evaluation of Segmentation
--> Map extracted segments from BP-HMM to videos
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iqjotpciyara6we/AAAzRf5687V9c4ksK30GAmKva?dl=0

2nd Goal: Try out as much as these ideas as possible

-->	IDEA1: Extract relevant joints by hand

-->	IDEA2: XYZ Coords of relevant joints (wrist/knees or knees), relative motion
	Using extracted xyz coords 
	(For this you can search in the mocap toolbox, there is a function that converts skel + channels to xyz coordinates)

-->	IDEA3: XYZ Coords + Virtual Force Signal
	Compute contacts from xyz coords and 3D point clouds

-->	IDEA4: Use PCA + GPLVM on Joint Data

	http://www.jdl.ac.cn/user/jbpang/GPSTVM.htm
	http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~jmwang/gpdm/

-->	IDEA5: Replicating experiment in-house to fuse different data channels


Goal of trying out all of these ideas is not to only have a good segmentation, but also to extract useful information from the models that could be used as informative priors to a probabilistic controller. (Jose)
