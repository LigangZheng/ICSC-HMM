MATLAB Implementation of the Multivariate Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection algorithm:
	run "code/multigauss_demo.m" for new version, considering only run lengths starting from last changepoint


Lightspeed toolbox: dependency needed to run the univariate code.
To install, enter the "lightspeed" folder and run "install_lightspeed" from Matlab.


Other versions:
Multivariate first (slow) version:
	run "code/multigauss_first_demo.m", found in "code/other examples" for version considering all run lengths

Univariate version: run "unigauss_demo.m", found in folder "code/other examples".
Code for "Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection" by Adams and MacKay.
